# Hackustry
First Mindustry cheat mod ever made.

### Some clarifications
At this point this mod isn't really a cheat mod anymore. it has became a large testing and utility mod (with a messy codebase). you still can cheat using it, and cheating isn't always bad, and it was known as *the* cheat mod before which is the reason i'm labeling it "cheat mod" here. also i'll port this mod to [groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) because javascript will be getting limited again in mindustry 7.0.
