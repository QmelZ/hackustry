# Hackustry v3

Hackustry v3: The world's first vanilla-compatible\* cheat mod for mindustry

# Vanilla-Compatibility

Hackustry v3 does not add anything new, it just uses vanilla features to implement the cheats. Meaning that you can safely use a vanilla save with hackustry and a hackustry save with vanilla, without anything breaking or the game crashing.

# For older releases:

v1: [QmelZ/Hackustry-v1](https://github.com/QmelZ/Hackustry-v1)

v2: [QmelZ/Hackustry-v2](https://github.com/QmelZ/Hackustry-v2)

# Features

- Adds:
  - Nothing
- Uses vanilla code to implement everything
- Can be used without losing any data. (My testing, I am not responsible for any data lost.)
